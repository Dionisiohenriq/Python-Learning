There are some ways to write strings code with quotes in python:
"This is an example"
"This is anoter 'example'"
"""This is "another" 'example'"""

This is because the interpretator need the same pattern to recognize a begin and a end of the string. 
These example will evaluate an error:
"This is "an" example"
'This is 'an example' 


There are three types of numbers in python: int, float, and complex numbers

numbers of type int are integer values: a = 496, b = 593
we can check the type of a number with function type(x)

float numbers have a decimal point: a = 2.5, e = 2.71828128

complex numbers: a = 2 - 6.1j, python uses 'j' to identify the imaginary part of a complex number
to acess the first value, type a.real, and to imaginary a.imag, both numbers of a complex variable are floats


in python the number types are int, float and complex
a int value are narrower than float and a float is narrower than a complex number
this means that you can't convert a narrower type number to a wider:
a = 25
float(a)
int(a) # this cause an error
complex(a)
float(a) # this cause another error

The math operations in python are: + - * /
We can evaluate a exponenciation by doing a ** b
Division can be made in 3 ways: 
a / b # always returns a float number
a % b # returns the reminder
a // b # returns the quotient

In multiplicantion and in the others operations, an operation will return its wider type
like a = 2 * b = 2.0 the result: 4.0

python help can be used to lear more about functions of python modules:
dir() # shows the modules that are built-in python
